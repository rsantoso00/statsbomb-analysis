An analysis of a football match using free data provided by Statsbomb
On this project I am analayzing one of the matches in women's UEFA EURO 2022 where Iceland's women national team is taking on France's women national team
Here, I have created a shot map consisting the location of shots made by both teams and also shot map of certain individual players with their expected goal percentage （xG）
